1)MongoDB definition?

A)In general , we use sql/mysql where we arrage the data in tables(rows and coloums),but when it comes to MongoDB which is a NoSQL language where the user arrage the data in the form of 'collections' and 'documents' which is like a record .These collections are stored in the 'JSON' formate . In JSON fromate they hold key and value pares .The key is automatically generated by MongoDB , under this key value hold the collection or document

2)Mongoose, models and schema definition?
A)Mongoose is the part of mongodb . Mongoose is a ODM library Object document mapping . Mongoose helps user to connect and interact with database . Mongoose controls the general mongodb API and provides with much easy to way access and connect with DB 

3)Schema and Models definition?
A)Schema defines the structure of a type of data/documents 
    -properties and propertie types
==>User Schema                       Blog Schema
    -name(string) required            -title(string) required
    -age(number) required             -snipped(string) required
    -bio(string) required             -body(string) required
==>Models 
Models allows us to communicate with database collection

the models have both static and instince methods(get,delete save ect)  which is connected to user database

//mongoose and mogo sandbox routes
app.get('/add-blog',(req,res)=>{ //here we are creating new instince to our schem and adding the data 
    const blogtest=new Blog({
        title:'Testing 2',
        snipped:'testing data connection and data transfer',
        body:'Here we are testing the connection, transfering the data into db and making sure everying is running we this test'

    });
    blogtest.save()//here we are saving the data we added using a method called save()
        .then((result)=>{
            res.send(result)
        }).catch((err)=>{
            console.log(err)
        })
})
//here we are find whole data which is store in db using a method called find()
app.get('/all-blogs',(req,res)=>{
    Blog.find()
        .then((result)=>{
            res.send(result)
        }).catch((err)=>{
            console.log(err)
        })
})
//here we are finding a databyId() to find selected or certain data selected by user 
app.get('/single-blog',(req,res)=>{
    Blog.findById('61b923b7125c6e34e2ab78ba')
    .then((result)=>{
        res.send(result)
    }).catch(err=>{
        console.log(err)
    })
})
